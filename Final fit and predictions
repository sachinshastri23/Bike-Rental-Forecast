Finally our model is fitted on test dataset to return predicted values to target data ('cnt').
This predicted data is the matched against testLabel dataset to calculate root mean square error (RMSE).
Final RMSE comes out to be: 39.50507676859462, which was less than the threshold value of 45, which classifies our prediction model as accurate.
