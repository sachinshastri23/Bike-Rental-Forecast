Firstly, the dataset consists of 17379 entries (rows/instances) &  total 17 columns/features.
Out of all these instances we have zero null/na values in our dataset.

Upon an overview of the given dataset, it contains some features which may not be needed for this problem:

  instant - This is just an index holder.
  casual - It contains the count of casual bike riders, which are already included in the overall users count i.e. 'cnt', hence not needed.
  registered - It contains the registered bike riders, which again, like the casual riders, are already included in the overall users count i.e. 'cnt', hence not needed.
  atemp - It is the 'feel' temperature, which may not be needed, as we already have 'temp' feature which contains temperature of the area - duplicate feature, hence     not needed.
  dteday - It is the Date. Since, our prediction is not based on the Date, its based on hour of the day, hence Date is not needed.

Hence, these features are dropped for further anaysis.

Scaling: Features like temp, hum & windspeed are in different ranges, hence they would require scaling.
  This we carry out by calling StandardScaler function from Scikit learn library.
  Upon carrying out fit_transform on these features, we get their respective standard deviations as:
                                                                  temp         1.000029
                                                                  hum          1.000029
                                                                  windspeed    1.000029
Since, we require an hourly prediction of bike rental, we create a new feature, dayCount by dividing
