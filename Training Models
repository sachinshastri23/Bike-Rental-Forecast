Creating a test & train split of the dataset.
  Since train_test_split() function uses random sampling, hence the dataset split needs to be sorted by 'dayCount' feature.
  We create a 70:30 train-test split.
  Creating a trainingCols feature after dropping 'cnt' feature from training dataset.
  Absorb the 'cnt' feature in new dataset named trainingLabel.
  
Various predictive models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and ensemble methods like Random Forest Regressor are used. 
Root mean square error is calculated for each of the models with cross-validation (cv=10)
Errors are as follows:
  Linear Regression: Mean of RMSE:141.1902290118175
                     Standard deviation: 37.55565075919573
  Decision Tree: Mean: 8.03049759858746
                 Standard deviation: 25.035783082114 
  Random Forest Regressor: Mean:
